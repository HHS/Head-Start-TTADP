With N=15, a single `minimatch()` call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever.\n\n\n### Details\n_Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._\n\n### PoC\nWhen minimatch compiles a glob pattern, each `*` becomes `[^/]*?` in the generated regex. For a pattern like `***************X***`:\n\n```\n/^(?!\\.)[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?X[^/]*?[^/]*?[^/]*?$/\n```\n\nWhen the test string doesn't contain `X`, the regex engine must try every possible way to distribute the characters across all the `[^/]*?` groups before concluding no match exists. With N groups and M characters, this is O(C(N+M, N)) — exponential.\n### Impact\nAny application that passes user-controlled strings to `minimatch()` as the pattern argument is vulnerable to DoS. This includes:\n- File search/filter UIs that accept glob patterns\n- `.gitignore`-style filtering with user-defined rules\n- Build tools that accept glob configuration\n- Any API that exposes glob matching to untrusted input","reported_by":null,"title":"minimatch has a ReDoS via repeated wildcards with non-matching literal in pattern","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2026-26996"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"minimatch","vulnerable_versions":"<10.2.1","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 10.2.1 or later","patched_versions":">=10.2.1","updated":"2026-02-18T22:38:11.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-1333"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26"}}}
