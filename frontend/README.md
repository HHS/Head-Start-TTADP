# TTADP Frontend

A React frontend initialized with Create React App

## Getting Started

There are yarn commands for starting/testing/linting the frontend defined a directory up. `yarn start` or `yarn docker:start` a directory up will start both the backend and frontend. `yarn docker:test` or `yarn test:all` will test the frontend and the backend. However if you want to just run the frontend tests/linter you can run yarn commands in this directory. Install dependencies with `yarn install`. `yarn start` will fire up the development server. Use `yarn test` and `yarn lint` for running tests and the linter.

### Yarn Commands
