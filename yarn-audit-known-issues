It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory.\n\nApplications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed).\n\nThe `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected.\n\nFinally, a second and lesser bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll vulnerabilities described are fixed in v8.0.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf using a version of jsdiff earlier than v8.0.3, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.\n\n### References\n\nPR that fixed the bug: https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649\n\n\n### CVE Notes\n\nNote that although the advisory describes two bugs, they each enable exactly the same attack vector (that an attacker who controls input to `parsePatch` can cause a DOS). Fixing one bug without fixing the other therefore does not fix the vulnerability and does not provide any security benefit. Therefore we assume that the bugs cannot possibly constitute Independently Fixable Vulnerabilities in the sense of CVE CNA rule 4.2.11, but rather that this advisory is properly construed under the rules as describing a single Vulnerability.","reported_by":null,"title":"jsdiff has a Denial of Service vulnerability in parsePatch and applyPatch","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2026-24001"],"access":"public","severity":"low","module_name":"diff","vulnerable_versions":">=5.0.0 <5.2.2","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 5.2.2 or later","patched_versions":">=5.2.2","updated":"2026-01-30T17:13:36.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-400","CWE-1333"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx"}}}

With a very small XML input, it’s possible to make the parser spend seconds or even minutes processing a single request, effectively freezing the application.\n\n### Details\nThere is a check in `DocTypeReader.js` that tries to prevent entity expansion attacks by rejecting entities that reference other entities (it looks for & inside entity values). This does stop classic “Billion Laughs” payloads.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t stop a much simpler variant.\n\nIf you define one large entity that contains only raw text (no & characters) and then reference it many times, the parser will happily expand it every time. There is no limit on how large the expanded result can become, or how many replacements are allowed.\n\nThe problem is in `replaceEntitiesValue()` inside `OrderedObjParser.js`. It repeatedly runs `val.replace()` in a loop, without any checks on total output size or execution cost. As the entity grows or the number of references increases, parsing time explodes.\n\nRelevant code:\n\n`DocTypeReader.js` (lines 28–33): entity registration only checks for &\n\n`OrderedObjParser.js` (lines 439–458): entity replacement loop with no limits\n\n### PoC\n\n```js\nconst { XMLParser } = require('fast-xml-parser');\n\nconst entity = 'A'.repeat(1000);\nconst refs = '&big;'.repeat(100);\nconst xml = `<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY big \"${entity}\">]><root>${refs}</root>`;\n\nconsole.time('parse');\nnew XMLParser().parse(xml); // ~4–8 seconds for ~1.3 KB of XML\nconsole.timeEnd('parse');\n\n// 5,000 chars × 100 refs takes 200+ seconds\n// 50,000 chars × 1,000 refs will hang indefinitely\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a straightforward denial-of-service issue.\n\nAny service that parses user-supplied XML using the default configuration is vulnerable. Since Node.js runs on a single thread, the moment the parser starts expanding entities, the event loop is blocked. While this is happening, the server can’t handle any other requests.\n\nIn testing, a payload of only a few kilobytes was enough to make a simple HTTP server completely unresponsive for several minutes, with all other requests timing out.\n\n### Workaround\n\nAvoid using DOCTYPE parsing by `processEntities: false` option.","reported_by":null,"title":"fast-xml-parser affected by DoS through entity expansion in DOCTYPE (no expansion limit)","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2026-26278"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"fast-xml-parser","vulnerable_versions":">=4.1.3 <5.3.6","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-jmr7-xgp7-cmfj","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 5.3.6 or later","patched_versions":">=5.3.6","updated":"2026-02-17T21:30:12.000Z","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cwe":["CWE-776"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jmr7-xgp7-cmfj"}}}
