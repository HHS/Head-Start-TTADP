It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory.\n\nApplications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed).\n\nThe `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected.\n\nFinally, a second and lesser bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll vulnerabilities described are fixed in v8.0.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf using a version of jsdiff earlier than v8.0.3, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.\n\n### References\n\nPR that fixed the bug: https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff/pull/649","reported_by":null,"title":"jsdiff has a Denial of Service vulnerability in parsePatch and applyPatch","metadata":null,"cves":[],"access":"public","severity":"low","module_name":"diff","vulnerable_versions":"<8.0.3","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 8.0.3 or later","patched_versions":">=8.0.3","updated":"2026-01-14T21:34:16.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-400","CWE-1333"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx"}}}
