The attacker must be able to do something malicious by adding extra parameters (that were not intended to be user-controlled) to this request. Depending on the target system's handling of repeated parameters, the attacker might be able to overwrite values in addition to appending values (some multipart form handlers deal with repeats by overwriting values instead of representing them as an array)\n- Reveal values of Math.random(). It's easiest if the attacker can observe multiple sequential values, but more complex math could recover the PRNG state to some degree of confidence with non-sequential values. \n\nIf an application is vulnerable, this allows an attacker to make arbitrary requests to internal systems.","reported_by":null,"title":"form-data uses unsafe random function in form-data for choosing boundary","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2025-7783"],"access":"public","severity":"critical","module_name":"form-data","vulnerable_versions":"<2.5.4","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 2.5.4 or later","patched_versions":">=2.5.4","updated":"2025-07-21T19:04:58.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-330"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4"}}}
