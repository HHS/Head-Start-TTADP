/**
* This query collects all the FEI and near FEI goals based on several criteria.
*
* The query results are filterable by the JDI flags. All JDI flags are passed as an array of values
* The following are the available flags within this script:
* - jdi.regionIds - one or more values for 1 through 12
* - jdi.recipients - one or more verbatium recipient names
* - jdi.grantNumbers - one or more verbatium grant numbers
* - jdi.goals - one or more verbatium goal text
* - jdi.status - one or more verbatium statuses
* - jdi.createdVia - one or more verbatium created via values
* - jdi.onApprovedAR - true or false
* - jdi.response - one or more verbatium response values
* - jdi.createdbetween - two dates defining a range for the createdAt to be within
*
* zero or more JDI flags can be set within the same transaction as the query is executed.
* The following is an example of how to set a JDI flag:
* SELECT SET_CONFIG('jdi.createdbetween','["2023-10-01","2023-10-15"]',TRUE);
