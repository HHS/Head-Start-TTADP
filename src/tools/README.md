## Manual monitoring import

These are the steps to manually import monitoring and generate any Goals associated with new monitoring review findings.

### Prerequisites

- Cloud Foundry CLI (cf CLI) installed.
- SSH access to the tta-smarthub-prod application in cloud.gov.
- Be logged into the production environment using the following command before running the script:

```bash
cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso
```
and chose the production option (option 2 as of the writing of these instructions)

### Basic command sequence

1. `cf ssh tta-smarthub-prod` to connect to the app
2. `/tmp/lifecycle/shell` to get a shell with the correct environment
3. `node ./build/server/src/tools/importSystemCLI.js download 1` to fetch the next zip file from ITAMS
4. `node ./build/server/src/tools/importSystemCLI.js process 1` to process the contents of the zip file into the database
5. `yarn createMonitoringGoalsCLI` to create any monitoring Goals indicated by the new data

The download and process steps will need to be run once each per day that needs catchup, such as on a Monday after the weekend. Thus, the steps would go: 1,2,3,4,3,4,3,4,5.

### Adding validation via the prod database

1. `cf connect-to-service tta-smarthub-prod ttahub-prod` to connent to the production database console
2. `SELECT "ftpFileInfo"->>'name' filename ,status, "createdAt" FROM "ImportFiles" ORDER BY 3 DESC LIMIT 4;` to inspect the progress of steps 3 and 4 above
This will show the last four files downloaded. If only step 3 has been run, the process is finished if `status` has reached `COLLECTED`. If step 4 has been run, the process is finished if it reaches `PROCESSED`
3. `SELECT LEFT(r.name,35) recipient, "regionId" region, COUNT(*) cnt FROM "Goals" g JOIN "Grants" gr ON g."grantId" = gr.id JOIN "Recipients" r ON gr."recipientId" = r.id WHERE "createdVia" = 'monitoring' AND g."createdAt" > (NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour') GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 2,1;` creates a small report of monitoring goals created in the last hour. It is useful after step 5 and looks something like:
```
              recipient              | region | cnt
-------------------------------------+--------+-----
 Municipality of Sandaar             |      2 |   1
 New Yorker Child Service Agency     |      2 |   1
 Island Support Center               |      2 |   1
 Young People's Assistance Refuge    |      3 |   1
 Harborville Jackson Aid Center      |      5 |   1
 Community Services of South Odding  |      5 |   1
 Houndingdon Public School District  |      8 |   1
 Superior Academy                    |      8 |   1
 South Desert Communities            |      8 |   1
 Caperton Public Services, Inc.      |      9 |   1
```
This may be important information OHS will want to know if the import is being run manually for some reason.
