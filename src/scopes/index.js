 *   activityReport: { where: SEQUELIZE OP, include: SEQUELIZE INCLUDE },
 *   grant: { where: SEQUELIZE OP, include: SEQUELIZE INCLUDE },
 *   recipient: { where: SEQUELIZE OP, include: SEQUELIZE INCLUDE },

 * options is right now only {
 *   model: {
 *      subquery: Boolean
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * but the intent is to build upon it as we need more and more bespoke queries
 *
 * right now the parameter "subset", is used to indicate
 * that the scopes returned should be to produce a total subset based on which model is
 * specified. that feels like a bit of word salad, so hopefully that makes sense.
 *
 * In the current use case for this option, we are sometimes query for activity reports
 * as the main model but in the overview widgets we also need a matching subset of grants
 * so this specifies that the grant query should be returned as a subset based on the activity
 * report filters. I'm not sure about the naming here.
 *
 * @param {} filters
 * @param {} options
 * @returns {obj} scopes
