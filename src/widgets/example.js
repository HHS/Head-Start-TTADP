  Widgets on the backend should only have to worry about fetching data in the format required

  (say for a time series). All widgets will need to honor the scopes that are passed in. All
  that is required is that the scopes parameter is used as value for the `where` parameter (or
  combined with [op.and] if the widget needs to add additional conditions to the query).

  If adding a new widget be sure to add the widget to ./index.js
