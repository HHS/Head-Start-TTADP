        ---------- The steps -------------------------------------------------
        -- 1: Find all Goals that are open FEI, Monitoring, or CLASS goals
        -- 2: Complete any In Progress Objectives not on those Goals
        -- 3: Close all other Goals
        -- 4: Delete any non-approved reports, of ANY kind.
        -- 5: Add the prestandard boolean column, making all closed records
        --    "true", but all future records "false" by default.
