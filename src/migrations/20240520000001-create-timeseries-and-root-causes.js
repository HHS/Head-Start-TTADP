      // This starts by creating a stored procedure that can be

      // usage: SELECT create_timeseries_from_audit_log('<tablename>')
      // example: SELECT create_timeseries_from_audit_log('Goals')
      // creates Goals_timeseries
      
      // Resulting tables are like their source tables except:
      // * id becomes data_id and is only unique when combined with the timeband
      // * timeband_start identifies the beginning of the timeband of a particular
      //   record state
      // * timeband_end identifies the ending of the timeband were the record has
      //   that state
      // * enums are converted to text values because enums change over time and
      //   thus historical data may not fit current enums

      // Root causes were not saving to ActivityReportGoalFieldResponses
      // on multi-recipient ARs where a goal already had a root cause
      // for one recipient. Because ActivityReportGoalFieldResponses
      // is supposed to have the root cause as it was at report approval
      // time, which can differ from the current root causes for goals
      // as recorded in GoalFieldResponses. Calculating what the state of
      // root causes at the time of AR approval is aided by having a
      // time series of GoalFieldResponses to join into with the addition of
      // of a check like:
      // LEFT JOIN GoalFieldResponses_timeseries gfrt
      //   ON arg."goalId" = gfrt."goalId"
