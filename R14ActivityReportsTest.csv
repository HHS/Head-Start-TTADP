Grantee Progress: Grantee continues to provide in-person services through partner sites and virtual services in managed sites. Pyramid Model implementation continues as program will schedule an Administrator training for Center Coordinators and continues to review process and forms. 

T/TA Provided: ECS opened with a question of the day activity to begin conversation.  ECS then led grantee into review of T/TA priorities within ECS scope of work that further supports the current DEF/ANC’s. Meeting participants identified program’s strengths as community collaborations, SIU as grantee, connections among families, children and staff. Growth opportunities were identified as enhancing systems to support program and ensuring systems are evident to all staff. Supporting collaborations across all sectors and building understanding that program pieces connect toward a common goal. Strengthening reflective practices among staff. 

The group reviewed current coaching needs assessment designed to identify needs and reflect practices within providing services during COVID 19. Instructional Services/Coach asked ECS about thoughts on using the reflective needs assessments with all staff and then through individual discussions determine any other potential area of focus and completion of second-level assessment. ECS agreed it could be helpful in many capacities including overall wellness support. ECS encouraged grantee to consider revision to scoring criteria to allow for a greater range between; I am comfortable and always use and I struggle and rarely use. ECS suggested “I struggle” may not be entirely accurate. It could be staff are unsure or just rarely use the practice but aren’t at level of “struggling” and possibly staff may shy away from declaring “I Struggle”. 
Grantee shared the successes of “Ask the Coach” sessions with teaching staff. Plans are in place to begin similar idea with Center Coordinators (CC). Rather than the teacher Munch and Learn, coaches will hold a Coffee Chat with CC’s to follow up on Munch & Learn sessions, allow time for administrator’s training for Pyramid Model and encourage use of reflective practices. 

Participant’s requested continued support with program’s implementation of social/emotional system working with on-going check-in’s, making revisions, and providing feedback as requested.  

Progress toward Outcome: ECS and Instructional Services/Coach (ISC) outlined program strengths and growth opportunities, discussed desired T/TA outcomes, aligned to corrective action plan and identified strategies and dates throughout the program year. T/TA activities will include continued support for Social/Emotional Plan implementation and support to revise/refine coaching needs assessments that support staff’s reflective practices.

ECS and leadership team, including Head Start Director (HSD), participated in a brainstorming session to review strengths and areas to strengthen in the next program year. The discussion included the following:
*ECS shared the intention and purpose of developing a TTA Plan in coordination and the connection to the grantee’s annual planning time.
*HSD and leadership team gave an update of the grantee, including:
>COVID updates – Children coming in 4-days a week.  Staff are in offices full-time.  Home Visitors are still remote, with office time 2 days a week. All home visits continue to be virtual. The first dose of vaccines completed for staff that signed up with 70 staff out of 200 receiving the first dose.
>Two changes to org. chart including the addition of two Coordinators to assist in supporting direct service staff, a Family Service Coordinator to supervise Family Service staff, the manager oversees all of PFCE & ERSEA.  And a Home-Based Coordinator to directly supervise home visitors. These transitions are still occurring.  ECS encouraged the HSD to discuss these changes with assigned GS to consider these positions as considering communication and implementing this change with staff.  In addition, as part of QI (quality improvement) funds, a parent educator will be hired to focus on meeting the needs of families – this position is currently posted.
>Grantee changes – two key positions are being absorbed within other people’s job duties due to grantee eliminating positions in IT and finance. The program was not ready for this change and did not have time to plan effectively. 
>Current enrollment: EHS – 97%; HS = 60% -lost families due to access to technology resources and those that were choosing not to stay enrolled. 
>HS – 3 childcare partnerships (44 children). EHS – 1 home visitor partner (24).
*Team reviewed the TTA Plan as developed in the fall during the Initial Engagement visit.  Successes were identified and topics to carry over to this program year were identified.
*Team completed an analysis of strengths and areas to strengthen in the areas of school readiness (SR); parent, family, and community engagement (PFCE); and career development.
-Strengths: 
>Developed a COVID plan to ensure the health and safety of staff and children.
>Used technology to our advantage, including providing technology to families as needed.
>Increased attendance at virtual socialization.
>Staff worked together to implement services when not fully staffed.
>Working hard to provide services to families and children.
*Team reflected and de-briefed around the areas to strengthen and voted on the areas they considered a priority. 
>Continuous improvement strategies for School Readiness.  Is there a more effective way to work.  Ensuring all areas are being worked on, including reviewing and revising transition systems between EHS and HS and HS to kindergarten. (Carried over from last TTA plan) In addition, increasing staff knowledge and awareness in effective teaching practices in the area of math and language/literacy.
>Continuous improvement strategies for PFCE, including continuing work from last TTA plan, as well as exploration of the Relationship-Based Competencies and strengthening staff understanding of positive parent engagement.
>Connecting PFCE and School Readiness (Carried over from last TTA plan)
>Implement a system of coaching and mentoring throughout the program (Carried over from last TTA plan). 
>Review and revise, as needed, systems around active supervision including data collection and aggregation; active supervision on the playgroup and transportation; and supporting families in understanding the safety of their children.
>Review and revise coordinated approach around professional development, disabilities, dual language learners, and data.

HSD identified strengths as having many experienced staff, community collaborations including newer one with University of Illinois Extension to share space in HS building providing a variety of events including a cooking classes for parents, Kindergarten transition committees, and having Southern Seven Health Department as the grantee. Growth opportunities identified as finalizing coaching system, increasing parent engagement and using current documents, identifying gaps to combine into a coordinated approach format. Program has worked toward a formalized coaching approach however having 3 different coaches in the position throughout the process has provided challenges. ECS reminded grantee of the PBC Program Leader’s Guide provided during implementation academy as a tool to support planning. ECS and identified implementation team will review current plan alongside other training and PD activities to finalize the formal coaching system including evaluation of services and incorporate into a Training and Professional Development Coordinated Approach. FA 1 identified the program’s transition committee as a strength however grantee wants to review practices for consistency among sites and review school readiness goals in conjunction with alignment to new child assessment DRDP. HSD shared the decline in overall parent engagement but concern with lack of/low attendance at parenting curriculum sessions. ECS suggested a review of the curriculum thru lens of parent interests expressed on program surveys, grantee desires a look at the use to fidelity and possibilities for increasing parent engagement throughout the program.

Brainstormed ideas for a smooth transition for children and families from EHS to HS, and HS to the school with the following conversations:
•	Reviewed the Supporting Transitions: Early Educations Partnering with Parents document discussing strategies to support EHS to HS transitions breaking it down into these sections: Parent-Team Member, Child-Team Member, Setting-Setting.
•	Some ideas brainstormed for Parent-Team Member section include: Staff sharing stories of what they like best about working with the family and child and what they are going to miss; asking parents what will be challenging for their child, what gets their child excited, how does their child manage stressful situations, what soothes their child; what are their hopes and expectations for themselves and their child in the new program; what are their fears/challenges moving into the new setting; transportation fears/issues worked in advance, and many more.
•	Some ideas brainstormed for the Child-Team Member section include: making a countdown calendar to help the child understand the journey of moving from the current setting to the new one; help arrange for the child and family to visit the new program; Make a book with the child’s favorite foods, activities, a me book for the child to give to the new teacher, and many more.
•	Some ideas brainstormed for the Setting-Setting section include: pre-meeting between teachers to learn about their background and cultural background in regard to the child – this one may be for the parent and the new setting too; and learn routines about the new setting.
•	Referred to the HSPPS on Transitions looking for the timeline of when to start Transitions and found that EHS is 6 months prior to the Transition; however, HS did not state a timeline. Recommended the program review the HSPPS deeper to see if a timeline is listed for HS in that section or a different section. 
•	Discussed transitioning children to another setting if they no longer qualify for Head Start. Asked how early a program can determine if they qualify for Head Start and staff will talk to their ERSEA person to find out the answer. 
•	Another idea brainstormed were to add a question of the month to the home visits for EHS HB for home visitors to ask. 
•	Briefly discussed a few HS to Kindergarten transition ideas. Determined a need to create a timeline next. ECS will send the resources discussed today along with the Kindergarten Transition resources. ECS referred to the Transition box the program received. Program will review the resources prior to the next meeting.
