# 11. Monitoring

Date: 2020-11-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

TTA Smart Hub requires a continuous monitoring solution to ensure uptime and error resolution.

## Decision

TTA Smart Hub will utilize New Relic for Monitoring.

* Integrates easily with front end and backend code
* Track performance metrics and errors
* FedRAMP approved
* Handles alerting both by itself, and via integrations with more flexible alerting platforms as we grow.

## Consequences

Log analysis and performance monitoring becomes far easier with New Relic in place.
