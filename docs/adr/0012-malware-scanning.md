# 12. Malware Scanning

Date: 2020-12-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to satisfy the [RA-5](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/RA-5)
control around vulnerability scanning, we wish to scan all user-uploaded files
with a malware detection service. These files are user-supplied, and thus
cannot fit into our other security controls built into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Decision

We will run a ClamAV daemon, fronted by a REST API that we will pass all user-uploaded
files through as part of the upload process. The ClamAV app is maintained in a
[separate government-controlled repository](https://github.com/HHS/Head-Start-clamav-api-cg-app)

## Consequences

While our user-supplied files will now have vulnerability protection, this architecture
does not provide scanning of the application itself. Therefor we must find other solutions
to addressing SI-3 or RA-5 in the context of the application.
