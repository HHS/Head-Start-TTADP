# Analytics

New Relic provides tools for application monitoring and web analytics. New Relic's [Application Performance Monitoring (APM)](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/) can monitor and measure application performance and activity on the backend. Their [Browser Agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/) can do the same for the frontend of the application.

We can [create custom dashboards](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/) in New Relic that visualize the various metrics we collect, and combine metrics from the backend and frontend.
